      <p>I'v been creative director at <a href="https://www.zivtech.com/">zivtech</a> since 2013 and I have over 10 years experience in web design and development. UX and usability is something that I am quite passionate about. I feel fortunate that I'm able to use my foundation in design to create engaging and intuitive experiences for web-based applications and the people that use them.</p>

<p>Since earning my BFA in Graphic and Interactive Design from Tyler School of Art at Temple University in 2006, Iâ€™ve been fascinated with idea of using design principles to help identify and solve the complex and nuanced challenges people are faced with when navigating a website or application interface.</p>
