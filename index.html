<p>In 2010 I was given the unique opportunity to grow as both a designer and developer at <a href="https://www.zivtech.com/">zivtech</a> and in 2013 I was promoted to my current role as creative director. In addition to directing the visual presence of the company, writing front-end code and performing peer code review is of paramount importance to my daily responsibilities. Although the greater part of my time is spent using CSS &amp; SASS, HTML, jQuery, and a bit of PHP to build responsive Drupal themes, as creative director Iâ€™m also responsible for creating wireframes, graphical layouts, and user interfaces. </p>
