In addition to directing the visual presence of the company, writing front-end code and performing peer code review is of paramount importance to my daily responsibilities. Although the greater part of my time is spent using CSS & SASS, HTML, jQuery, and a bit of PHP to build responsive Drupal themes, as creative director Iâ€™m also responsible for creating wireframes, graphical layouts, and user interfaces.
